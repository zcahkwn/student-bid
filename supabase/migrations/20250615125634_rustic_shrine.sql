  # Fix Classes Table RLS Policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies on classes table
    - Create new policies that allow anon and authenticated users to perform CRUD operations
    - Ensure RLS remains enabled for security

  This fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error by allowing
  the application to create, read, update, and delete classes without authentication issues.
