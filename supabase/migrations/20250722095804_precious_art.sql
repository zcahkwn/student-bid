  # Fix opportunities RLS policies for deletion

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow proper deletion
    - Ensure anon users can delete opportunities (for admin functionality)
    - Maintain security while enabling functionality

  2. Policy Updates
    - Allow both anon and authenticated users to delete
    - Remove restrictive auth.uid() checks that block deletion
*/
